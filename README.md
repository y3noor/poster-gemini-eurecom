# Gemini Theme with Eurecom Colors

## Project Origin
This project originates from the [Gemini theme](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini) created by Anish Athalye. The Gemini theme is designed for academic posters, providing a clean and professional look. This version has been customized to incorporate the official colors of Eurecom, a renowned research institute in the fields of communication systems and digital sciences.

## Eurecom Theme Colors
The Eurecom theme uses a specific color palette that aligns with the institute's branding guidelines. The primary colors used in the theme are:

1. **Eurecom Navy Blue**: This is a deep, authoritative blue (RGB: 0, 70, 130) that serves as the primary color for titles, headings, and separators.
2. **Eurecom Light Blue**: A softer, more approachable blue (RGB: 100, 143, 255) used for backgrounds and highlights.
3. **Pantone 2995 C**: A vibrant blue (RGB: 0, 159, 223) used as a primary highlight color.
4. **Light Gray**: A neutral background color (RGB: 230, 230, 230) that complements the blue tones and ensures readability.
5. **100% Cyan**: Another variant of vibrant blue (RGB: 0, 159, 223) used for specific highlights.
6. **Light Orange**: A subtle, contrasting color (RGB: 255, 242, 232) used in alert blocks for important information.

These colors are carefully chosen to maintain a professional and clean appearance while aligning with Eurecom's visual identity.
